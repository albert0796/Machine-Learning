### 2. [Machine Learning Notes](https://github.com/albert0796/MachineLearning/tree/master/ClassHangout)
- It is a lecture note made for the machine-related courses offered in the graduate schools of Soochow University. It covers multiple machine learning methods, including EDA, Bayesian, Clustering, Decision Tree, Dimension Reduction, Ensemble, KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Regression, SVM, Validation. Each method has note of concept and demo of source code.
- The Final project aims to predict S&P 500 index’s Close price ten days ahead, using daily features (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) of each day, including the current day and the past 30 days. Noticeably, it applies cross-validation to tune hyperparameters. To avoid overfitting and maintain the model’s robustness, it chooses hyperparameters which has max value of mean test score + 1.96 * std test score in cross-validation.

### 3. [Deep Learning-Based Candlestick Pattern Recognition System](https://github.com/albert0796/MachineLearning/tree/master/Pattern%20Hunter)
To take advantage of the candlestick pattern recognition to a great extent and support the trader, we build an AI-based system that can absorb professional traders' domain knowledge and excel in visual recognition. Moreover, the system can automatically execute the procedure and have the customized user interface. And the user of traders can avoid the human error and make investment more efficiently.

### 4. [Deep Learning-Based Recommendation APP for Taiwan Tourist Attractions](https://github.com/albert0796/MachineLearning/tree/master/Project_TaiwanDeepTravel)
[Project Report](https://github.com/albert0796/MachineLearning/blob/master/Project_TaiwanDeepTravel/README.md)
- This project won the championship in the National College Open Data Artificial Intelligence Competition.
- The project aims to build an iOS app that provides recommendations for tourist attractions in Taiwan to fulfill users' travel needs while visiting Taiwan. When users capture any interesting scenes around the world, and input them into the app, the system will utilize a deep learning model to recognize and recommend Taiwan tourist spots that are most like the captured scene.

### 5. [Cathlife Critical Illness Insurance Purchasing Data Analysis](https://github.com/albert0796/MachineLearning/tree/master/Competition_Cathlife)
[Analysis Document](https://github.com/albert0796/MachineLearning/blob/master/Competition_Cathlife/report/Cathlife%20Critical%20Illness%20Insurance%20Purchasing%20Data%20Analysis.pdf)
1. The project won the 34th place out of 300 nationwide in the Cathay Life Big Data Competition when I represented the lab to participate during internship at IF.Lab.
2. The project aims to utilize customers' historical data to predict whether existing customers will purchase critical illness insurance policies within a specific timeframe. The model will help identify customers with higher insurance needs and provide sales professionals with a method to target potential customers.
3. The analysis focuses on the domain-based data analysis, and also places lots of effort on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. And, those pre-processing methods and model construction also covers multiple machine learning methods.

### 6. [Ensemble Machine Learning on Crowdfunding Data for Project Status and Amount Pledged Prediction](https://github.com/albert0796/MachineLearning/tree/master/Paper_CrowdFunding)
1. The project aims to evaluate the success status and the final pledge amount of a launched project at the early stage in Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which are two world-famous crowdfunding platforms.
2. To predict the success status and the final pledge amount of a launched project, I apply the Stacking, an ensemble machine learning method, to make prediction. Furthermore, I also train multiple machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning and compare the performance of the Stacking model with those models. For more details of the project, please refer to the GitHub.
