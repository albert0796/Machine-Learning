## Description
It is a teaching note I made for a deep-learning-related class I taught in the financial innovation course, offered by Prof. Yun-Cheng Tsai in National Taiwan University, when I was a lecturer. The class is about applying deep-learning-based visual recognition to financial trading strategy, like candlestick pattern recognition. 

The class covers the concept of trading strategy and the deep learning model and how to put the idea into practice. The practice includes data processing, time series data encoding and Convolution Neural Network modeling and predicting.
