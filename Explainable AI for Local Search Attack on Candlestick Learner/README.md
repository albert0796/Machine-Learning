# Explainable AI for Local Search Attack on Candlestick Learner

Candlestick pattern recognition is a critical financial trading technique by visual judgement on graphical price movement. Through the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it has been able to reach very high accuracy. However, the lacking of explainability and transparency still makes CNNs a black box and unjustifiable in trading decision-making. Besides, further investigation has also suggested the problem of explainability in the CNN-based model. Hence, in addition to exposing the black box, the study in this paper provides a framework to enhance the modelâ€™s explainability. It creates an innovative data augmentation method to generate training aid samples for model training and forces the model to learn human domains.  
Keywords: explainable artificial intelligence, data augmentation, local search adversarial attacks, candlesticks, time series encoding, financial vision.
