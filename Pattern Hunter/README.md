# PatternHunter – A Deep Learning-Based Candlestick Pattern Recognition System

### Introduction
The candlestick pattern recognition is one of the post popular investment techniques among professional traders. The essence of this techniques is that it doesn’t have a very objective or rigid rule. Instead, each trader depends on their unique trading intuitiveness and knowledge to visually recognize the profitable candlestick pattern. Therefore, to take advantage of this technique to a great extent and support the trader, we build an AI-based system that can absorb professional traders’ domain knowledge through its complicated neural network and excel in visual recognition with the convolutional structure. Moreover, since the system can automatically execute the procedure and have the customized user interface, the user of traders can avoid the human error and make investment more efficiently.
